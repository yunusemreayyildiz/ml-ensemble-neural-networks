# Advanced Machine Learning & Neural Networks Pipeline

This repository contains a comprehensive series of Machine Learning tasks focusing on data visualization, ensemble learning techniques, and the architectural nuances of Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP).

## Project Overview
The project is structured as a step-by-step exploration of the machine learning pipeline, moving from initial data understanding to complex model optimization. It demonstrates proficiency in handling both traditional statistical methods and modern neural network architectures.

## Repository Structure
The project is organized into logical modules to reflect a professional data science workflow:

* **`Data_Analysis_and_Visualization/`**: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand feature distributions and correlations.
* **`Classification_Basics/`**: Implementation of fundamental classification algorithms as a baseline.
* **`Ensemble_Learning/`**: Advanced techniques including **Bagging**, **Boosting**, and hyperparameter tuning for ensemble learners.
* **`Neural_Networks_MLP/`**: Deep dive into **Multi-Layer Perceptrons**, covering convergence analysis, hidden layer impact, and robustness against data noise.
* **`plots/`**: Visual outputs, including performance metrics and decision boundaries.
* **`Report.pdf`**: A detailed technical report documenting the methodology, experimental results, and conclusions.
